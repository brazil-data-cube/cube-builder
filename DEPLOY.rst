Deploying
=========

The ``docker-compose.yml`` in the root of the source tree can be used to run cube-builder as a multi-container application.


This section explains how to get the cube-builder service up and running with Docker and Docker Compose.
If you do not have Docker installed, take a look at `this tutorial on how to install it in your system <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_.
See also the `tutorial on how to install Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_.


Configuration
-------------

docker-compose.yml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open and edit **docker-compose.yml** with the following variables:

1. **DATA_DIR** - Path to store collections.
2. **SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI** - Database URI.
3. **RABBIT_MQ_URL** - URI to connect on RabbitMQ protocol.


Running the Docker Containers
-----------------------------

.. note::

    If you do not have a PostgreSQL instance with the Brazil Data Cube data model up and running, you will need to prepare one before following the rest of this documentation.


    In order to launch a PostgreSQL container, you can rely on the docker-compose service file. The following command will start a new container with PostgreSQL:

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ docker-compose up -d postgres


    After launching the container, please, refer to the section "Prepare the Database System" in the `INSTALL.rst <./INSTALL.rst>`_ documentation. This will guide you in the preparation of the PostgreSQL setup.


Use the following command in order to launch all the containers needed to run cube-builder [#f1]_:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker-compose up -d


If the above command runs successfully, you will be able to list the launched containers:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ docker container ls

    | For now you will need to login into the BDC registry:
    | ``$ docker login registry.dpi.inpe.br``

    | In the next releases we will get ride of this internal registry.
